For the final project, you are expected to:

Pick an interesting Social Web problem;
For example, you may want to help people affected by a given socially-related issue;
or you may want to help a given category of workers;
or, again, you may want to understand how many users discuss a given topic, how, why, and what does this imply;

An EXTENDED analysis and report of Social Web data

Pitch your idea and present the final result.
Describe your (individual) contribution to the assignment (individual chapter of the report).
Collect the results of your work in an ANALYSIS REPORT (to be included in the report):

Step 1: Formulate a research question to answer with your data
Step 2: Describe the data used and the way it was collected
Step 3: Describe what pre-processing you performed on the data, if any; explain why it was necessary
Step 4: Visualise the non-preprocessed data, if any, to show the importance of data cleaning
Step 5: Carry out the necessary analyses and visualise your results (e.g., graphs, barplots etc.). Show how you answer your research question with these analyses
Step 6: Describe the limitations of your data and analysis or app
Step 7: Share your code via GitHub or alternative services. Preferably you should construct interactive visualisations


General Idea

The US elections in 2020 is a trending topic on Social Network Services (SNS) such as Twitter and Facebook. SNS have proven themselves to be a great influence on society sparking controversy in for example the 2016 US elections. This gives rise to the following question: To what degree can data mining of social network services predict the outcome of an US election? The idea is to mine data from Twitter and Facebook related to the USA elections in 2016 surrounding the republican candidate "Dondald Trump" and democratic candidate "Hillary Clinton". The data collected can be compared to data of the real US elections outcomes of 2016. The gathered information and analysis of the data can present great insight in actual SNS influence on world politics.
