For the final project, you are expected to:

Pick an interesting Social Web problem;
For example, you may want to help people affected by a given socially-related issue;
or you may want to help a given category of workers;
or, again, you may want to understand how many users discuss a given topic, how, why, and what does this imply;

An EXTENDED analysis and report of Social Web data

Pitch your idea and present the final result.
Describe your (individual) contribution to the assignment (individual chapter of the report).
Collect the results of your work in an ANALYSIS REPORT (to be included in the report):

Step 1: Formulate a research question to answer with your data
Step 2: Describe the data used and the way it was collected
Step 3: Describe what pre-processing you performed on the data, if any; explain why it was necessary
Step 4: Visualise the non-preprocessed data, if any, to show the importance of data cleaning
Step 5: Carry out the necessary analyses and visualise your results (e.g., graphs, barplots etc.). Show how you answer your research question with these analyses.
Step 6: Describe the limitations of your data and analysis or app
Step 7: Share your code via GitHub or alternative services. Preferably you should construct interactive visualisations
